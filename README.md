# groundfix

A Sourcemod plugin for preventing various movement bugs related to hitting the ground.

Currently implemented:
* Slope sliding fix
* Edgebug fall height fix

Note that this does not fix "random" bugs when already sliding on a slope or surf ramp â€” only a specific bug that occurs when landing initially.
